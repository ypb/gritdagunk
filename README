What is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~

Gritdagunk  is   Prontomere  --  a  hopeless   exploration  in  widely
misunderstood   computational   aptationism   (whatever   remains   of
"adaptationism"  theorized out  of all  practical cases  of particular
ad-aptivism)   and  hopefully   exercise  in   narrowly  "understood"
artificial embryogeny (of the  "nerve nets" kind).  Main motivation is
to concentrate on the  problem of representing the "ecosystem". Modest
goal:   yet   another  vaporware   virtual   machine  or   half-arsed
implementation  of  Lisp.  Ultimate  goal:  spontaneous  emergence  of
self-replicating  complex  adaptive   sub-systems  (sic!).   For  less
condensed and more outragous blurb see doc/10-BLUB.
